# Time Series Forecasting of Sales
This analysis is mainly about forecasting for upcoming sales in a video game company. Firstly, I investigate and prepare the time series data. The provided data was appropriate to use time series models and I held out the last 4 periods of data points for validation. Then, I determined Trend, Seasonal and Error components in the data based on decomposition plots. After that, I analyse the data by applying the ARIMA and ETS models and describe the errors for both models. I compared the in-sample error measurements to both models and compare error measurements for the holdout sample in the forecast. Finally,I choose the best fitting model and forecast the next four periods.
